objective: 
-using the input, sum up the total points you scored based on the moves
  played and whether you lost, tied, or won the round

opponent moves: A is Rock, B is Paper, C is Scissors
your moves: X is Rock, Y is Paper, Z is Scissors

X (Rock) is one point  
Y (Paper) is two points
Z (Scissors) is three points

loss - 0 points added
draw - 3 points added 
win -  6 points added 

X draws against A, loses against B, and wins against C 
Y wins against A, draws against B, and loses against C 
Z loses against A, wins against B, and draws against C 

when opponent plays:
A you play Y
B you paly X
C you play Z

algorithm:

-extract the opponent and player chars using istream get()
-pass the characters to roundscore which takes the chars as arguments
  and returns the points that player earned in the round
-keep a running total of player points
-extract some more characters and loop if they arent EOF
